# CSCI551-project!
**Simplified implementation of Onion Routing Protocol**

Implementation of  **Mantitor**, a simplified version of a TOR-like Onion Router as described in the paper by Dingledine et al. **(see *[Dingledine04a]*)**.

The purpose of the CSci551 project is to get some hands on experience building a substantial distributed application running on a multi-process computing infrastructure, then to use it to study networking.
